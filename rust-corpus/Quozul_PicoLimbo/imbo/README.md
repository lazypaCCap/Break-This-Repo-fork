## Introduction

PicoLimbo is a lightweight [limbo server](https://quozul.dev/posts/2025-05-14-what-are-minecraft-limbo-servers/) written
in Rust, designed primarily as an AFK or waiting server. Its core focus is on efficiency by implementing only essential
packets required for client login and maintaining connection (keep-alive) without unnecessary overhead.

While not aiming to replicate every Minecraft server feature, PicoLimbo supports **all Minecraft versions from 1.7.2
through 26.2**, excluding snapshots.

## Features

### 🎮 Wide Version Compatibility

Supports all Minecraft versions from **1.7.2 to 26.2** natively, no need for ViaVersion or additional compatibility
layers.

### ⚡ Ultra-Lightweight & Highly Scalable

Uses **0% CPU while idle** and handles **hundreds of players** under 10 MB RAM.
[View benchmarks](https://picolimbo.quozul.dev/about/benchmarks.html).

### 👤 Skin Support

Player skins are supported. What else to say about that?

### 🔀 Built-in Proxy Support

Integrates with all major Minecraft proxies:

- Velocity (Modern Forwarding)
- BungeeCord (Legacy Forwarding)
- BungeeGuard & BungeeGuardPlus authentication

### ⚙️ Highly Configurable

Customize your server using a simple TOML configuration file, including welcome message, spawn dimension, server list
MOTD, and more. [View configuration docs](https://picolimbo.quozul.dev/config/introduction.html).

### 🌍 Schematic World (Experimental)

Load a custom world from a schematic file and customize spawn location (1.13+ only).
