//! Boss bars: the strip across the top of a client's screen.
//!
//! # A bar is an entity and its audience is a set of edges
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let bar = world
//!     .entity()
//!     .add(BossBar::id())
//!     .set(Title(Text::text("CPU 240% of 1600%").color(NamedColor::Red)))
//!     .set(Progress(0.15))
//!     .add((ShownTo, operator));
//! ```
//!
//! and later `bar.set(Progress(0.31))`, which sends one `UpdateProgress` to
//! each viewer and nothing else. There is no packet in a caller anywhere.
//!
//! # Why the sent state is pair data and not a table
//!
//! [`Sent`] holds exactly what one client was last told, as the data on the
//! `(Sent, viewer)` pair. That one choice is what makes the two cases that are
//! usually bugs stop being code at all:
//!
//! * **Somebody joins mid-match.** They have no `(Sent, bar)` pair, so the
//!   next tick sends them `Add` for every bar whose audience they are in.
//!   Joining is the absence of state rather than a handler.
//! * **Somebody leaves, or a bar is destroyed, or the audience shrinks.** All
//!   three end with the pair going away -- flecs removes it itself for the
//!   first two, under the `(OnDeleteTarget, Remove)` cleanup written down in
//!   [`BossBarModule::module`] -- and one `OnRemove` observer on
//!   `(Sent, Wildcard)` sends the `Remove`. Teardown cannot leak, because the
//!   fact that says "this client has this bar" and the thing that gets cleaned
//!   up are the same fact.
//!
//! # Nothing unchanged is resent
//!
//! The drive system compares each viewer's [`Sent`] against the bar's
//! components and emits only the operations whose field moved. An unchanged
//! bar sends nothing at all. That is not a micro-optimisation: hyperion#1018
//! measured 3,065 boss bar packets in thirty seconds for eight clients from a
//! bar that resent itself whenever its progress moved by any amount, against
//! 1,135 once the game quantised what it asked for. A bar is a packet per
//! viewer per change, and a caller that sets the same value every tick is the
//! normal case rather than the exceptional one.
