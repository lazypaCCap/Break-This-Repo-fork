//! Who the client thinks is online, and what they look like.
//!
//! A client will not render a player it has no profile for. `createEntityFromPacket`
//! in `ClientPacketListener` refuses an `AddEntity` of kind `player` whose
//! profile id is not already in `playerInfoMap`, logs "Server attempted to add
//! player prior to sending player info" and returns null, so before this module
//! existed no player could see another player at all: hyperion sent the entity
//! and never sent the tab list entry that gives it a face.
//!
//! Three things about the client's bookkeeping shape everything here.
//!
//! - `handlePlayerInfoUpdate` adds new entries with `putIfAbsent`, so re-sending
//!   `ADD_PLAYER` for a profile id it already knows is a no-op. Changing a
//!   profile means removing it first.
//! - `AbstractClientPlayer` caches the `PlayerInfo` it was built with, so a
//!   remote player also has to be dropped and re-added for a new profile to
//!   reach the renderer.
//! - `PlayerInfo.createSkinLookup` passes `requireSecure = !isLocalPlayer`, and
//!   `SkinManager.createLookup` then drops any skin whose
//!   `MinecraftProfileTextures.signatureState` is not `SIGNED`. An unsigned
//!   `textures` property is enough for a player to see their own skin and is
//!   silently ignored by everyone else.
//!
//! Verified against the 26.2 client jar (sha1 2dc72797acbc1b63fc16a11c4ac393605f453754)
//! and authlib 9.0.75, which ships inside the server bundle this repository
//! already pins.
//!
//! # A texture change never costs a player their world
//!
//! This module used to hand the wearer a `Respawn`, on the reasoning that
//! rebuilding `LocalPlayer` is the only thing that clears the cached
//! `PlayerInfo` in the third bullet above. It does, and it also throws away
//! everything else the client had: `handleRespawn` replaces `ClientLevel`
//! wholesale, so the player loses every chunk and every entity in one packet.
//!
//! Giving those back is not a matter of re-sending terrain. Chunks could be
//! restreamed from here, but entities could not: which entities a client is
//! subscribed to is the proxy's bookkeeping, keyed on position, and it has no
//! reason to re-offer a subscription the client already holds. So a respawn
//! left the wearer standing in an empty hub with no podiums, no mobs and
//! nobody else in it, and the operator saw the terrain half of that as
//! "Loading terrain..." forever.
//!
//! So [`refresh`] does not respawn. The wearer's profile entry is replaced,
//! which is what the tab list reads, and every *other* client drops and
//! re-adds their entity, which is what puts the new skin on the model that
//! matters. What is deliberately not fixed is the wearer's own first-person
//! view of themselves, which keeps the texture their `LocalPlayer` was built
//! with until something rebuilds it. That is one pair of arms against every
//! client's whole world, and it is the trade this file makes on purpose.
