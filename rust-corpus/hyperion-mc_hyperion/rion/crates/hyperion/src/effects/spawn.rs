//! Putting a new entity in the world.
//!
//! The [`Spawn`] tag and the observer behind it already do the work: give an
//! entity a kind, a position and a rotation, enqueue `Spawn`, and every client
//! nearby is sent an `add_entity`. What was missing is that the observer needs
//! five components present and says nothing useful when one is absent, so
//! every caller wrote the same five `set`s and one of them eventually wrote
//! four.
//!
//! [`spawn`] is those five in one call. It hands the entity back rather than
//! finishing the job, because what a projectile, a dropped item and a
//! decoration need after that have nothing in common.
