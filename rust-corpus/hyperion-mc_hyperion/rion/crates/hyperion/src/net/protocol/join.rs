//! Putting a 26.2 client into the world.
//!
//! The one packet that means a player has joined is `Login`. Anything short of
//! it -- an accepted profile, a finished configuration, a connection the proxy
//! still counts -- leaves the client on "Joining world..." indefinitely while
//! every count on the server says it is online. That failure has happened here
//! before, so this module exists to make the transition into play one call with
//! one caller rather than something spread across a channel.
