//! Serving Minecraft 26.2 (protocol 776) with `hyperion-minecraft-proto`.
//!
//! This module holds the seam every clientbound 776 packet goes through: a
//! body from the proto crate paired with the id for the state it is sent in.
//! The proto crate deliberately keeps ids out of the bodies, because the same
//! body has different ids in different states.
//!
//! The transport does not change with the protocol. hyperion frames packets
//! itself -- a `VarInt` length, then an optionally zlib-compressed body with a
//! `VarInt` id -- and the proxy forwards bytes without reading them, so
//! [`crate::net::encoder`], [`crate::net::decoder`] and `packet_channel` are
//! shared between the two protocols rather than duplicated.
