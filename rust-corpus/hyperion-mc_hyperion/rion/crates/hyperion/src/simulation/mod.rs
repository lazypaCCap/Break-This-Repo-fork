//! The game world: what exists in it, and what the rules do to it each tick.
//!
//! This module is wiring. [`SimModule`] registers every component the
//! simulation owns and every observer that reacts to one changing, and that
//! registration order is load-bearing rather than incidental. What the
//! components mean lives in the submodules, and the ones declared here are
//! markers with no behaviour of their own.
//!
//! The split runs by subject, not by size:
//!
//! - [`pose`] is where an entity is and how big it is, which nearly every
//!   other system reads and almost none of them write.
//! - [`blocks`] is the world itself, loaded and streamed by chunk.
//! - [`handlers`] and [`packet`] are the inbound edge, turning what a client
//!   sent into events other modules can watch.
//! - [`event`] is that vocabulary of events.
//! - [`lookup`] finds an entity again from an id a packet carried.
//! - [`metadata`] is the per-entity-kind state the client has to be told.
//! - [`command`], [`inventory`], [`flight`], [`gamemode`], [`animation`],
//!   [`skin`], [`xp`] are one game concept each.
//!
//! Nothing here knows which game is being played. That is `events/`.
