//! Decoding and acting on the packets a playing client sends.
//!
//! Every id here comes from
//! [`hyperion_minecraft_proto::generated::packet_id::play::serverbound::PacketId`],
//! which is generated from Minecraft 26.2's own data (protocol 776). The ids
//! are not the ones valence uses for 1.20.1: `chat` moved from 5 to 9,
//! `swing` from 47 to 63, `container_click` from 11 to 18, and the movement
//! packets from 20..=23 to 30..=33. A stale table does not error, it runs the
//! wrong handler on bytes that parse, which is why [`route`] resolves an id
//! through the generated enum rather than through integer literals, and why
//! anything it cannot place is logged rather than dropped.

// Every handler shares one signature so that `route` can hand back a function
// pointer, which leaves several of them returning a Result they never fail.

// client chose, so a panic reachable from any of it is a remote crash of the
// whole process for every connected player. Denying these here makes the next
// `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` on client input a build failure rather than a P0:
// a handler that cannot represent a value must return `Err` (the shared
// signature already carries one) and let the caller kick the connection, not
// abort the server. Fallible conversions that genuinely cannot fail get an
// `#[expect(clippy::unwrap_used, reason = "...")]` naming the invariant, so the
// exception is visible in review rather than silent.
