//! Reference bytes produced by Mojang's own encoders.
//!
//! `tests/fixtures/vanilla.json` is the output of
//! `nix run .#minecraft-encode -- fixtures <file>`, which drives the real
//! `StreamCodec`s and netty handlers in the pinned server jar. It is committed
//! so `cargo test` works without nix, and the `minecraft-encoder-fixtures`
//! flake check fails if the committed copy drifts from what the jar produces.
//!
//! The parser below is deliberately tiny: the file is a flat map of string to
//! string with no escapes beyond the two `quote` in the harness emits, and a
//! JSON dependency for that would be the only dev-dependency in the crate.
