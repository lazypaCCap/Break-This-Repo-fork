//! Hot reloading for flecs game modules, gated on schema migrations.
//!
//! A module is a dylib exporting one entry point. On reload the engine builds the new
//! build's component tree in a throwaway world, diffs it against the running one, and
//! either swaps the code, applies developer-written migrations, or refuses -- naming the
//! component, both layouts, and the migration that is missing.
//!
//! See `docs/hot-reload.md` for what is detected, what is refused, and what is not caught.
