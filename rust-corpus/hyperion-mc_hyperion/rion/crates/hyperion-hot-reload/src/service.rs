//! Answering a service manager's reload request, between two ticks and never during one.
//!
//! # Why the host owns its tick loop
//!
//! A reload deletes and re-creates every system and observer a module registered, and may
//! rewrite stored component bytes. Doing that while flecs is mid-frame is not a race that
//! shows up as a wrong number; it is a system table being rebuilt underneath an iterator.
//! So the reload has to happen at a point where no frame is in progress, and the only such
//! point is between `world.progress()` calls -- which means the host has to be the thing
//! calling `progress`, rather than handing control to `ecs_app_run` and never getting it
//! back. [`run`] is that loop, and it is the whole reason this module is not simply a
//! flecs system.
//!
//! # The protocol is one verb, and the answer is one line
//!
//! `ExecReload` runs a client that connects to a unix socket in the unit's runtime
//! directory, writes `reload`, and prints whatever comes back. The reply is a single line:
//!
//! ```text
//! accepted <module> <revision>
//! refused <reason>
//! ```
//!
//! The client's exit status is taken from the first word, so a refused reload fails the
//! `systemctl reload` that asked for it instead of being a line in a log nobody reads. The
//! refusal text is the gate's own, which names the component and both layouts.
//!
//! Nothing in the request says *what* to load. The module path and the revision file are
//! fixed at startup, so `ExecReload` is a constant string and a deploy that changes the
//! rules dylib does not change the unit's `[Service]` section -- which is exactly the
//! condition under which systemd reloads rather than restarts.
//!
//! # The revision comes from a file, never from the environment
//!
//! A process's environment is fixed at `exec` time. Reading the build revision from
//! `HYPERION_BUILD_REV` would therefore report the build the process *started* as, forever,
//! and a hot reload's entire point is that the process does not restart. The revision is
//! read from a path on every accepted reload, so it says what was just loaded.
//!
//! A missing or unreadable file is reported as an unknown revision rather than as a failed
//! reload. The revision is a label for humans; refusing to load working code because a
//! label is missing would be the wrong trade.
