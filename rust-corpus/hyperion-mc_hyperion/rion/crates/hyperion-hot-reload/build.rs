//! Two jobs, both about making the dylib boundary safe to cross.
//!
//! First, record the exact compiler that built this crate: `repr(Rust)` has no stable
//! ABI, so a module and a host built by different rustc versions can disagree about the
//! layout of any type they pass. The recorded string is compared at load time.
//!
//! Second, keep flecs's C symbols in this dylib and exported from it. rustc links
//! `libflecs.a` into whichever artifact first needs it and dead-strips the rest, and it
//! restricts a dylib's export list to that crate's own Rust symbols. Without this, a game
//! module that links `hyperion-hot-reload` dynamically finds no `ecs_*` symbols and gets
//! its own static copy of flecs instead -- two `ecs_os_api` globals in one process, which
//! shows up as a jump through a null function pointer at the module's first allocation.
