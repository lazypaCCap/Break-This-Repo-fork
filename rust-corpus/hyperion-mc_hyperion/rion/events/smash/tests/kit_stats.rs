//! Every field of [`KitStats`] has to be able to change the game.
//!
//! The gate is one test per field, and each one is the same shape: two players
//! on kits that are byte-for-byte identical except for that one field, the same
//! scenario run against both, and a difference required in what a client would
//! see at the end of it. A field that cannot be made to matter is a field with
//! no implementation, and it fails here.
//!
//! This is deliberately stronger than "every field has a reader", which
//! `let _ = stats.regen;` satisfies. ENG-11450 is what it is for: `regen`,
//! `hunger_interval`, `jump_power` and `jump_control` were set by every one of
//! sixteen kits, several of them tuned against the wiki and argued about in
//! comments, and read by nothing at all. Nothing failed, because nothing asked
//! this question.
//!
//! The five fields that already worked are gated too, and they are not filler:
//! they are the evidence that the harness below can tell a difference when
//! there is one. A gate whose only passing cases are the ones written alongside
//! the feature is a gate nobody has watched work.
