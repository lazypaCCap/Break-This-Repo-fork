//! Properties of the game, checked over generated input.
//!
//! The hand written tests in this directory each pin one situation somebody
//! thought of. These pin the rules that have to hold in *every* situation,
//! which is where the bugs nobody thought of live: `tests/game_flow.rs` proves
//! that four specific deaths eliminate a player, and this file proves that no
//! sequence of any length gets a fifth life or a negative one.
//!
//! Two shapes here, and the split matters:
//!
//! * Pure properties over the formulas -- knockback, armour, the lobby state
//!   machine. Cheap, so they run at proptest's full case count.
//! * Whole world properties, where a generated [`Script`] drives a real flecs
//!   world and [`harness::invariants`] is checked after every tick. A world
//!   costs about a tenth of a second to build, so these run at a reduced case
//!   count and lean on the shrinker rather than on volume.

// Several properties here assert that a value did not change *at all*: that a
// refused activation cost no energy, that a hit inside the immunity window took
// no health. A tolerance would let exactly the bug being looked for through, so
// the comparison is exact on purpose.
