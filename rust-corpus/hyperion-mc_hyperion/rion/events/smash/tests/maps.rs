//! What a map file has to be true for, checked without a server.

//! `terrain.rs` asserts most of this at boot, which means a bad map is a server
//! that panics on start rather than a test that fails. Boot is also the only
//! place it was ever checked, so a map could be broken for as long as nobody

//! network, and fail on the map that is wrong rather than on the first one.
