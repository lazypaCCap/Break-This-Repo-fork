//! Every ability in the game, driven through the mock seam and held to what its

//!
//! This file names no kit and no ability. It walks [`ability::manifest`], which

//! the crate is covered the moment its module runs and a kit added tomorrow
//! fails here rather than passing quietly.
//!
//! What this proves and what it does not: this is the game half, so what it
//! reads is the call log of a [`MockServer`] -- the same calls the adapter turns
//! into packets. It says an ability computed the effect it promised. It does not
//! say the packet carrying that effect reaches a client, which is what
//! `nix run .#smash-e2e` is for, and which drives the same manifest.
