//! What each module needs, and what each module provides, made checkable.
//!
//! `tests/modularity.rs` proves that a *kit* can be added from outside the
//! crate. This is the other half of the same claim, one level down: that the
//! subsystems themselves are separable, so `SmashModule`'s import list is a
//! list of choices rather than an order somebody found by trial and error.
//!
//! The failure it exists to catch is silent. The workspace builds flecs with
//! `flecs_manual_registration`, so a module that reaches for a component
//! another module owns does not get a lazily registered one -- the process
//! aborts. In a match that is a crash. In a normal test it never happens,
//! because every test imports the whole game and every component is therefore
//! already there. So a dependency can be added between two modules and nothing
//! anywhere reports it until the day somebody removes a module from the list.
//!
//! Here each module is imported into a world containing only what it declares
//! it needs, and then actually exercised. A missing declaration aborts the
//! process, which nextest reports as that one test failing. `nix run .#test`
//! runs nextest; under plain `cargo test` the abort takes the whole binary
//! down, which is louder but no less correct.
