//! A whole game in a test, with no Minecraft server anywhere near it.
//!
//! Three things live here, and the last two are what let a generated test say
//! anything a hand written one cannot:
//!
//! * [`Game`], a world with the game and a recording server in it.
//! * [`Script`], a list of [`Action`]s a test can generate rather than write.
//!   The same script drives a property test and a replay, so a determinism
//!   failure and an invariant failure are found by one driver.
//! * [`invariants`], the things that must be true of the world at the end of
//!   every tick. [`Game::run`] checks them after each one, so a generated
//!   script reports the *first* tick that broke a rule rather than a final
//!   state that is wrong for reasons nobody can reconstruct.

// Each test binary compiles its own copy and uses a different part of it.
