//! The one file that imports both hyperion and the game.
//!
//! Writes cross the seam as a queue rather than as immediate world edits.
//! [`Server`] is called from inside flecs observers -- ability activation, the
//! damage pipeline, the lobby state machine -- where the world is mid-iteration
//! and taking a second mutable borrow of a component a running query is reading
//! aborts at runtime. Draining once per tick in `PostUpdate` costs knockback one
//! tick of latency and buys immunity from that whole class of bug.
//!
//! [`HotbarItem`] is the game's own closed vocabulary, and choosing which
//! Minecraft item each one becomes is a hosting decision, so that mapping
//! lives here and nowhere under `src/module/`. [`Sound`] and [`Particles`] are
//! the exceptions and arrive already naming a vanilla sound event and a
//! vanilla particle, because what an ability sounds and looks like is part of
//! what the ability *is* and belongs with the kit that declares it; all that
//! is left here is handing them to the engine.

/// The layout is written out below rather than assumed for a specific reason.
