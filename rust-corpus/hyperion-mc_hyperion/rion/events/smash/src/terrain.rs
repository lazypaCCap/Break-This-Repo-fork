//! Turning map descriptions into blocks hyperion serves, and choosing which
//! arena a match is played on.
//!
//! The world is empty to begin with -- `Blocks::empty` rather than a downloaded
//! save -- and every arena plus the hub is stamped into it at boot. That is what
//! makes the geometry real: a client walks on it, projectiles would collide with
//! it, and a player who falls off it falls past the kill plane rather than
//! landing on terrain that happens to be there.
//!
//! One world, several regions. The hub sits at the origin and each arena gets
//! its own [`REGION_STRIDE`]-wide slot along +X, so map files can be written in
//! local coordinates and switching maps is a teleport rather than a world load.
//! Mineplex switched worlds instead, because a Bukkit server could; hyperion
//! serves exactly one set of chunks, so the regions have to be far enough apart
//! that no view distance reaches from one to the next.
