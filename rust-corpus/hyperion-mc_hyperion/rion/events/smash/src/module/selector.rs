//! The kit selector: a ring of podiums in the middle of the lobby, one per
//! mob, and you right-click the one you want.
//!
//! ## What Mineplex did
//!
//! The SSM waiting lobby put one mob per kit on a pedestal and you clicked the
//! mob you wanted to be. The Mineplex Wiki describes the waiting lobby's
//! centrepiece as "mobs ... standing atop pedestals of coloured wool and stone
//! brick slabs, allowing you to click/right-click on them to select kits", and
//! its kit page notes that in SSM's case the pedestals carried "each individual
//! mob" rather than the stand-in zombies other games used. It also records what
//! the wool was for: the colour said what you had to do to unlock the kit, with
//! free kits yellow, gem kits green and achievement kits purple.
//!
//! This rebuilds both halves of that:
//!
//! * A podium is a wool block with the kit's own mob standing on it, and the
//!   mob is what you right-click. Not a head block, not an armour stand: the
//!   real entity, which is what makes the ring readable from across the lobby.
//! * The wool's colour is the status readout. Mineplex used it for "can you
//!   afford this"; this uses it for "has somebody taken this", which is the
//!   question a player in a filling lobby is actually asking.
//!
//! ## One player per mob
//!
//! Nothing found says whether Mineplex reserved a kit. Neither the wiki's kit
//! and waiting-lobby pages nor the SSM forum threads mention a reservation in
//! either direction, and since kits were bought per account with gems, a rule
//! that let one player lock another out of something they had paid for would
//! be a strange one to have shipped. So treat exclusivity as this server's
//! choice and not as a reconstruction: it exists because the operator asked
//! for a selector that answers when you click a mob somebody else has, and
//! "answers" is only meaningful if the answer is no.
//!
//! The claim lasts exactly as long as the player does, and it is enforced only
//! where a kit can still be changed. [`crate::module::lobby::choose`] already
//! refuses any change once the match commits, so past that point the claim is
//! frozen for the rest of the match without a second rule saying so, and a
//! player who disconnects frees their mob immediately because the edge that
//! was the claim goes with the entity. No disconnect handler exists here, and
//! that is the point: there is nothing to clean up.
//!
//! ## Everything here is relations
//!
//! A podium *is* its `(Offers, kit)` edge; there is no table from block
//! position to kit name and no id anybody has to keep in step. A mob being
//! taken *is* somebody's `(Playing, kit)` edge; see
//! [`crate::module::kit::claims`] for why that is derived on demand and never
//! written down.
//!
//! `/kit` and `/kits` still work and are still what the tests and a screen
//! reader use, but nobody should have to type a command to play.
