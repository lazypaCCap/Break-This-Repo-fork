//! Abilities are entities, and a kit grants them through a relationship.
//!
//! The alternative — an `enum Ability` with a `match` in an activation
//! function — is what makes adding a kit touch existing files. Here an ability
//! is an entity carrying its own cooldown, its own hotbar binding and its own
//! behaviour as a function pointer, so the dispatcher below never learns the
//! name of a single kit.
//!
//! Behaviour is a bare `fn`, not a `Box<dyn Fn>`: activation is rare enough
//! that one indirect call costs nothing, and a boxed closure would put an
//! allocation and a second pointer chase into a path that a kit author will be
//! tempted to call from a per-tick system.

///
/// - [`Self::HurtsTarget`] and [`Self::HealsCaster`] are `ClientboundSetHealth`

/// - [`Self::BuffsMelee`] is the same melee swing hurting more than it did
/// - [`Self::AfflictsTarget`] is a *second* `ClientboundSetHealth` for the
///   victim, on a later tick, with nothing cast in between
/// - [`Self::Sustains`] is any of those arriving again, later, with nothing
///   pressed in between
/// - [`Self::ShieldsCaster`] is the absence of one: a hit lands on the caster
