//! The sidebar, and the spectator flag that goes with being out.
//!
//! Mineplex's scoreboard is one line per player with their remaining lives as
//! the score, collapsing to two aggregate lines above fourteen players. Both
//! shapes are here because the collapse is what makes the mode playable in a
//! big lobby, and the colour of a name is the only warning you get that
//! somebody is on their last life.
//!
//! # The row is a component, and the number is the score
//!
//! A row used to be a `String` built with `format!("[{}] {} {}", colour, name,
//! lives)`, and the sidebar had three separate faults on screen at once.
//!
//! The colour was a placeholder `&'static str` nothing consumed, so `[green]`
//! reached a real client as literal text and the last-life warning this module
//! is built around had never once fired.
//!
//! The number in the red column was not the lives. The adapter set every row's
//! score to `lines.len() - index`, a reverse row index, so a panel of two
//! players and a status line read 3, 2, 1 down the side whatever anybody's
//! lives were. That is a sort key the protocol requires, drawn to the player
//! because nothing told the client to hide it, and read by the player as data.
//! Two rows both reading `Emerald_Explorer 4` against scores of 2 and 1 is
//! that bug: the lives agree, the numbers beside them do not, and neither
//! number is a life.
//!
//! Both faults widened the rows. Minecraft draws the score hard against the
//! right edge and sizes the panel to its widest row, so a row carrying markup
//! and a life count it did not need pushed the panel out until the red number
//! sat on top of the name.
//!
//! All three are the same mistake, which is describing presentation in a
//! string instead of in the structure the protocol already has. A row is now a
//! [`Text`] with a real colour and a [`Score`] beside it, and
//! [`Server::set_sidebar`](crate::server::Server::set_sidebar) will not accept
//! anything else.
