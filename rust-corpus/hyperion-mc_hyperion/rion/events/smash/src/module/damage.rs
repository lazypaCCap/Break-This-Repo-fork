//! Applying damage, and remembering who to credit for it.
//!
//! Damage and knockback are split across two events on purpose. [`Damaged`]
//! lowers health; only once that has happened is [`Smashed`] emitted, so the
//! knockback of a hit is computed against the health that hit left behind. If
//! both lived on one event the two modules would have to agree on observer
//! registration order, which is exactly the kind of implicit coupling that
//! makes a module list stop being reorderable.

/// the bench drives abilities from outside any system and so never defers.
