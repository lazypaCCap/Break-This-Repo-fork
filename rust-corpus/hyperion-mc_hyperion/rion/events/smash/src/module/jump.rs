//! The mid-air jump, which is vanilla creative flight with the flight taken
//! out.
//!
//! `[SOURCE]` Mineplex's `PerkDoubleJump` grants `setAllowFlight(true)`,
//! cancels the `PlayerToggleFlightEvent` the client's double tap produces, and
//! applies a velocity by hand. Nothing about that needs a modified client, and
//! nothing about it needs a new packet: the serverbound abilities packet a
//! vanilla client already sends *is* the jump key, and the only thing the
//! server has to do is refuse the flight and answer with an impulse.
//!
//! Three systems, which is the whole mechanic:
//!
//! * `arm_double_jump` keeps the client's flight permission equal to "airborne
//!   with a jump left", pushing it across the seam only when the answer
//!   changes.
//! * `spend_double_jump` answers a press: one jump off the counter, the
//!   permission rewritten so the player is not left flying, and the impulse.
//! * `restore_double_jump` puts the counter back on ground contact, which is
//!   what re-arms the whole thing.
//!
//! The counter itself is [`JumpsLeft`] and it lives in
//! [`crate::module::player`] with the rest of the state a player carries. This
//! module registers no components; it imports the modules that own the ones it
//! reads.

/// all twelve of them to exactly the same jump and the per-kit number would
/// stop meaning anything -- which is the shape of bug that made this mechanic
