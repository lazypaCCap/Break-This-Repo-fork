//! Sounds are entities, and whatever makes a noise points at one.
//!
//! The alternative is a `match` from an ability's name to a string. That is a
//! second registry: it lives in a different file from the abilities, nothing
//! makes the two agree, and the day a kit is renamed the game goes quiet in a
//! way no test notices. Here the sound is a component on the ability entity
//! itself, reached the same way everything else about an ability is reached, so
//! there is one registry and it is the world.
//!
//! Four relationships, named for the occasion rather than for the sound:
//!
//! * `(PlaysOnCast, sound)` on an ability -- what firing it sounds like.
//! * `(PlaysOnSelect, sound)` on a kit -- what the mob says when you pick it
//!   off its podium.
//! * `(PlaysOnHurt, sound)` on a kit -- what the mob you are playing says when
//!   it is hit.
//! * `(PlaysOnDeath, sound)` on a kit -- and when it dies.
//!
//! All four are `Exclusive`, because an occasion has one sound and a second
//! declaration is a correction rather than an addition. Without it a kit that
//! redeclares gets both edges and [`declared`] answers with whichever was added
//! first, which is a silently stale sound and no error anywhere.
//!
//! They are also `(OnInstantiate, Inherit)`, which is a storage choice and not
//! a behavioural one. [`crate::module::kit::apply`] gives a player their own
//! ability entities with `is_a(prefab)`; flecs' default is `Override`, which
//! copies the pair onto every instance, and `Inherit` leaves the one copy on
//! the prefab and resolves through the `IsA` edge. Both read back the same, and
//! this was checked by removing the trait and watching
//! `tests/sound.rs::firing_an_ability_plays_the_sound_it_declared` stay green.
//! `Inherit` is kept because a sound is static data shared by every instance,
//! which is what the trait is for, and that test is what would catch either
//! choice being wrong.
//!
//! What is *not* relational, deliberately: the impact sound a hit makes, the
//! countdown, and the two match-boundary sounds. See [`IMPACT`].
