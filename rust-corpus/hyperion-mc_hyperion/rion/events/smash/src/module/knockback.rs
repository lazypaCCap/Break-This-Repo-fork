//! Knockback: the only thing in Super Smash Mobs that actually kills you.
//!
//! Damage never kills in the common case. Damage lowers your health bar, a low
//! health bar makes every subsequent hit launch you further, and eventually a
//! hit launches you off the map. That inversion — health *down* meaning
//! knockback *up* — is Mineplex's restatement of Smash Bros' rising damage
//! percentage, and it is the one formula the whole game balances around.
//!
//! The numbers below are transcribed from Mineplex's own Java, not fitted:
//! `SuperSmash.java` supplies the health term and `DamageManager.java` plus
//! `UtilAction.velocity` supply the rest. See `docs/smash-design.md` for the
//! citations and for the two constants that are genuinely ours.
//!
//! Everything here is in Minecraft's native velocity unit, blocks per tick.
