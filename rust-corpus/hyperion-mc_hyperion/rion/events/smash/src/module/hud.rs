//! What the screen says while a match runs.
//!
//! Three surfaces, and one rule behind all of them: the game already knows
//! everything a player needs, and until now it only said so in words, after
//! the fact, on a channel that scrolls.
//!
//! * The **experience bar** is the recharge of whatever ability is in the slot
//!   you are holding. Cooldowns were already enforced and the only feedback
//!   was a line of red text *after* a press had been refused, which is the
//!   wrong end of the interaction: a gauge answers "can I" before you commit,
//!   and a refusal only answers "you could not" once you already have.
//! * The **bar across the top** is your knockback percentage during a match,
//!   and whatever the lobby is waiting on outside one. Percentage is the read
//!   Super Smash Mobs is played on and no client draws it: hearts say how much
//!   damage you have left, and percent says what the next hit will do with it.
//!   See [`crate::module::knockback::percent`].
//! * The **titles** punctuate the match. The countdown gets a number, the
//!   start gets a word, the end gets the winner's name, and a death gets the
//!   name of whoever did it.
//!
//! Everything that decides content is a pure function of a small struct, and
//! everything that decides *when* lives in a system or in the lobby's own
//! state machine. That split is what makes `tests/hud.rs` able to pin the
//! exact bar, number and wording for every state the game has, including the
//! ones a scripted match would have to be lucky to reach.
//!
//! # Nothing is sent twice
//!
//! Each of these is a packet per player, and the bar and the meter both change
//! continuously. [`Shown`] is what the client was last told, initialised to
//! the state a fresh client is already in -- an empty experience bar and no
//! boss bar -- so the first push is the first real change and every tick after
//! that sends nothing until the value moves. The experience bar is also
//! quantised to [`METER_STEPS`], which is what keeps a seven second cooldown
//! to sixty-four packets rather than a hundred and forty.
