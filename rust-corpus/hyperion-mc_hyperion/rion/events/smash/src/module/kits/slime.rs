//! Slime: the resource kit.
//!
//! Slime is the kit where the experience bar is the whole game. Slime Rocket
//! spends it to launch a piece of yourself, and the piece is bigger and hits
//! harder the longer you charged; the bar also *is* your hitbox, so spending it
//! makes you smaller and harder to hit while leaving you with nothing to spend.
//! Slime Slam is the aggressive option and it hurts you too — a quarter of the
//! damage and the knockback come straight back at you.
//!
//! Numbers from the `SMASH_KITS` spreadsheet dump.
