//! Wolf: melee that gets stronger the longer it stays on you.
//!
//! Ravage is the kit. Base damage is 5, the lowest of the melee kits, and every
//! landed hit stacks a bonus toward a ceiling of 8 that decays three seconds
//! after the last one. All three numbers are the wiki's.
//!
//! Stats verified: 5.0 damage rising to 8.0, 9 armour points (36%), and the
//! knockback figure -- the kit table says 150%, the kit's own page says 160%.
//! The kit page is the more specific source and is the one used here; the
//! disagreement is recorded in docs/smash-design.md.
