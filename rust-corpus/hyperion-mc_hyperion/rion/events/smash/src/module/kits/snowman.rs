//! Snowman: an aura that buffs your melee and slows whoever stands in it.
//!
//! Arctic Aura is the kit: +1 damage against anyone standing on your snow, and
//! very little knockback so they stay there. Both are the wiki's.
//!
//! Stats verified: 6.0 damage rising to 7.0 in the aura, 12 armour points
//! (48%), 140% knockback taken, 0.3 regen, 5000 gems.
