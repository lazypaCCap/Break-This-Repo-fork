//! Guardian: a grappler that marks one player and takes them apart.
//!
//! Target Laser is the kit and it is unusually well documented: melee rises
//! from 5 to 7 against the marked player, the mark needs them within ten blocks
//! and you on the ground, it lasts at most eight seconds, ends with a further
//! three damage, and puts the ability on a fifteen-second cooldown. All of that
//! is the wiki's.
//!
//! Stats verified: 5.0 damage rising to 8.0, 9 armour points (36%), 125%
//! knockback taken, 0.25 regen, 8000 gems.
