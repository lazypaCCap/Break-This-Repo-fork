//! Iron Golem: the melee kit.
//!
//! Highest melee damage and armour in the game, permanently slowed, and with no
//! ranged option at all — every ability exists to close distance or to punish
//! someone who let it. Iron Hook is the kit: land it and the victim arrives in
//! melee range whether they wanted to or not.
//!
//! Numbers from the `SMASH_KITS` spreadsheet dump unless noted.
