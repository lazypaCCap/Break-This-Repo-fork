//! Skeleton: the ranged kit.
//!
//! The first kit in the game and the one you get if you pick nothing. Every
//! ability is a bow or a way to survive someone reaching the bow: Barrage is a
//! hold-and-release that stacks up to five arrows, Bone Explosion is the panic
//! button with the highest knockback multiplier of any starting ability in the
//! game, and Roped Arrow doubles as its recovery.
//!
//! Numbers from the `SMASH_KITS` spreadsheet dump.
