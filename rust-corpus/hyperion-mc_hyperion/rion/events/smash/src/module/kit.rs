//! Kits are prefabs, and a kit is data.
//!
//! A kit module builds one prefab carrying the kit's stats and a child prefab
//! per ability, then never runs again. Choosing a kit instantiates the prefab
//! onto the player, which copies the stats and creates that player's own
//! ability entities with their own cooldowns.
//!
//! Nothing in this file, or in any other subsystem, knows the name of a kit.
//! That is the whole claim: [`crate::module::kits`] is an import list, and the
//! test in `tests/modularity.rs` adds a kit from outside the crate to prove it.
