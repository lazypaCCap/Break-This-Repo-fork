//! An effect is an entity, and afflicting somebody is an edge pointing at them.
//!
//! Fire, poison and a shield have nothing in common as fiction and everything
//! in common as bookkeeping: each is a thing put on a player at one moment,
//! which keeps acting on its own for a while, and then stops. Writing that three
//! times produces three expiry bugs, so it is written once here and the kits
//! differ only in the numbers they hand to [`afflict`].
//!
//! The alternative -- an `Option<f32>` per effect on the player, or an
//! `enum Status` with a match on it -- is the shape this crate spends its design
//! avoiding, and it also cannot express the thing that actually happens in a
//! match, which is being on fire from two different Blazes at once. Two effect
//! entities pointing at one victim is that, for free, and each keeps its own
//! kill credit because the attacker is an edge on the effect rather than a
//! field on the player.
//!
//! **Where this sits in the module DAG.** It needs `Player`, `Knockback` and
//! `Damage`, and nothing else, to import: a tick is a [`Damaged`] event and a
//! shield is `Damage`'s own [`Shielded`] list. The edge points one way -- `Damage`
//! knows nothing of effects -- which is why the tag lives over there rather
//! than here. It deliberately does *not* need `Lobby`: durations
//! are counted in delta time the way [`crate::module::ability::Cooldown`] and
//! `GrantedFor` are, not against the match clock, so an effect behaves the same
//! in the hub, in a test and in a match. `tests/contract.rs` states all of that
//! and holds it.
//!
//! What does not live here is anything a vanilla client renders for itself.
//! Minecraft has real Slowness and real Speed, delivered by
//! `ClientboundUpdateMobEffect`, and approximating either with repeated
//! impulses would read as lag rather than as a status. Those wait for the seam
//! to carry the packet.

// Why effects are anonymous, when almost everything else here is named.
//
// An anonymous entity is a row of numbers in the flecs explorer, which is open
// on the live server, and naming these "Inferno on Wolfsbane" was tried. It is
// wrong twice over, and both reasons are properties of `entity_named` rather
// than of the name chosen.
//
// `entity_named` is find-or-create: `ecs_entity_init` with a name set looks the
// name up first and hands back whatever it finds. Two Blazes burning one player
// therefore collapse into a single effect -- one burn wearing both their credit
// -- which is the exact property this module claims it gets for free from two
// entities pointing at one victim. `two_attackers_afflicting_one_victim_are_two_effects`
// is that claim, and it failed with `left: 1, right: 2` before this was undone.
//
// The second reason is worse because it is silent. `afflict` destroys any
// same-source effect before creating the replacement, and inside a system that
// destruction is deferred. The create would then find the doomed entity, hand it
// back, decorate it, and watch it be destroyed at the end of the frame. A
// refreshed burn would simply stop, with nothing reporting anything.
//
// So the rule this settles: `entity_named` is for things created once whose
// identity is stable -- kits, ability prefabs, the arena -- and not for
// short-lived entities that can legitimately exist more than once at a time.
// Effects and projectiles are both the second kind.

/// Start refusing hits on `victim`, effective immediately.
///
/// No duration is written here. What ends an effect's shield is the effect
/// expiring, which [`disarm_shield`] is, so a second copy of the duration on
/// the player would be a number with nothing to keep it honest.
///
/// The pipeline reading a list rather than querying for effects is deliberate:
/// `smash::apply_damage` runs on every hit in the game, and a relationship walk
/// per hit to answer a question that is false for almost every player almost
/// always is the wrong shape.
///
/// A shield is the one thing in this module that has to be true *within* the

/// component on the player. [`Shielded`] carries the whole reason.
