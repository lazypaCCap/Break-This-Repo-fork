//! Fixes to the `flecs_ecs` Rust API, carried locally until they land upstream.
//!
//! Everything here is an extension trait over an upstream type, which is the
//! shape an upstream patch would take as an inherent method. Each one is
//! zero-cost: no allocation, no boxing, no extra indirection over what the
//! upstream call already does. `docs/flecs-rust-api-notes.md` has the full
//! writeup, including the changes considered and rejected.
