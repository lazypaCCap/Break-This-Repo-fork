//! Map descriptions: what a Super Smash Mobs arena is, as data.
//!
//! Mineplex shipped every map as a world folder plus a `WorldConfig.dat` text
//! file, so a map was data a builder edited and never code a programmer
//! recompiled. That split is worth keeping, and it is the reason this is a
//! parsed text format rather than a table of Rust constants: the arenas here
//! are reconstructions, they will be wrong in their details, and a wrong
//! reconstruction should be fixable by editing a file rather than by knowing
//! Rust.
//!
//! It is not Mineplex's format. Theirs pointed at a world folder for the
//! geometry and carried only the metadata; the geometry is the part we do not
//! have, so this format has to carry it too. The brushes below are the smallest
//! set that draws a floating platform over a void, which is every SSM map.
//!
//! Files are compiled in with `include_str!` rather than read from disk at
//! boot. A game server started by `nix run` has no stable working directory,
//! and a map that fails to load is not a degraded server, it is a server with
//! no floor.
