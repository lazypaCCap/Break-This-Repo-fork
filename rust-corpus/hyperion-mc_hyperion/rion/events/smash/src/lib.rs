//! Mineplex Super Smash Mobs for the hyperion Minecraft engine.
//!
//! The game is an import list. Every subsystem and every kit is a flecs
//! [`Module`], so a deployment picks its feature set by choosing which modules
//! to import and a new kit is a new file plus one import line.
//!
//! [`SmashModule`] is the game and knows nothing about a host. [`SmashHost`] is
//! the game plus hyperion, and everything hyperion-shaped lives under it in
//! [`adapter`], [`mirror`], [`input`] and [`command`].

/// # Why the host does the logging
///
/// `hyperion-hot-reload` reports rather than logs, because it cannot depend on `tracing`
/// without duplicating it against `hyperion`'s copy -- see that crate's `Cargo.toml`. So
/// the severities are chosen here, and they are not the same for the two arms. **A refusal
/// is an `error`**: it means the deploy did not take, and the operator has to find it in a
/// query filtered by severity rather than by reading a log. An accepted reload is `info`,
/// which is what `hyperion-event-runner` defaults to precisely so this line arrives.
///
/// # Why the players are told at all
///
/// A reload is invisible from a client: nothing disconnects, nothing respawns, and the
/// only outward sign is that a rule behaves differently than it did a second ago. Somebody
/// in a match who is about to lose to a number that just changed deserves to know it
/// changed, and somebody watching their own deploy land needs the confirmation that it
/// landed. A title is the one channel that reaches a player looking at the middle of their
/// screen, which in a fighting game is everyone.
///
/// The build bar underneath is not a duplicate of it: the title is gone in a few seconds
/// and says "something just changed", the bar stays and says "to what".
///
/// # Why this is a callback and not an observer
///
/// A reload deletes and re-creates every system and observer the module registered, so an
/// observer is exactly the wrong shape -- the thing that would react to the event is the
/// thing the event just replaced. See `hyperion_hot_reload::service::run`, which calls this
